Anatomy of a class

	Data -> fields
	Behaviour -> methods / functions

Naming conventions
	Pascal case > First letter of every word should be upper case (SetName, Getname, etc...)
		used for naming classes and methods
	Camel Case > Firts word lower case and subsequent words should be upper case (setName, getName, etc...)
		used for naming fields and variables
		private fields should start with "_"

OOP Major concepts:
	-Encapsulation / Information Hiding
	-Inheritance
	-Polymorphism
   
   Encapsulation:
      -Define fields as private
	Fields are implementations detail we should hide from the outside
      -Provide getter/setter methods as public	
        With getters and setters we can have logic when accessing fields (like null checking in fields that cannot be null)

4.Properties -> A class member that emcapsulate a getter and a setter for accessing a field
	used to create getter/setter with less code
	Pascal Case for naming (exept on private fields)
